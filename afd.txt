Strong afternoon winds will quickly slacken near sunset as the upper 
trough exits the region, and cool air helps to decouple the strong 
winds aloft...and they lift up and away from the surface. Behind 
today's system a cool and dry airmass will drop in across the region 
on WNW flow. This will mean a cooler night with Wednesday morning 
temperatures very near seasonal averages...meaning some freezing 
temperatures at many locations. Dewpoints will be rapidly trending 
sharply lower overnight also, with a lower RH values expected for 
Wednesday.

Wednesday and Thursday will be the drier days of the week, with min 
RH in the 13-18% range across the lowlands. Winds will be lighter, 
by far, but some afternoon breezes will still be possible due to lee-
side surface troughing to our east. Another upper-level storm system 
will drop in from the north on Friday. That system looks to bring in 
a cold front from the north. The system looks pretty dry, with only 
slight chances for any precipitation Friday and Saturday. However it 
will bring colder air Friday and for the weekend ahead.  Vent rates 
lower after today due to lesser wind and shallow mixing to poor to 
fair for the rest of the week.
