Dry and warm west southwest flow will occur over the region today 
and tonight with an approaching storm system moving into the area on 
Friday.  The system will bring a mix of rain and high elevation snow 
to the mountains Friday and Friday night, but accumulations will be 
light. Lowland desert regions along the border will see dry and 
somewhat breezy conditions as a front pushes into the area. Overall 
fire impacts today will be minimal with low relative humidity values 
in the teens, with wind speeds expected to remain below criteria. 
Winds increase on Friday but so do relative humidity values as a 
result of cooler temperatures.  Vent rates will be poor to good 
today with some improvement along the Rio Grande Valley for Friday. 
Temperatures will continue to drop going into next week to about 5 
to 10 degrees below normal with little to no precipitation.
