.PREV DISCUSSION...220 AM MST Thu Nov 26 2020...

.SYNOPSIS...
Thanksgiving will be the Borderland's last abnormally warm day of
the forecast period before the weather pattern becomes much more 
active. The first weather system will skirt by the area Friday 
into Saturday bringing an increase in wind, a drop in 
temperatures, and a slight chance of rain and snow showers for far
northern and higher terrain locations. A dry backdoor cold front 
will then push in Sunday evening with stronger winds, putting a 
cap on our high temperatures. Monday and Tuesday look to be mostly
quiet before the next potential weather system sets its sights on
the Borderland.

.DISCUSSION...
.SHORT TERM...Today (Thanksgiving Day) and Tonight...
A dry west to southwest flow pattern aloft will occur ahead of an 
approaching low pressure system. The atmosphere remains very dry 
with just a few high level clouds passing over the area. Day time 
temperatures will be a few degrees warmer today as result with after 
noon highs as much as 10 degrees above normal. Surface winds will be 
from the west south west with at 10 to 20 mph with high gusts along 
east slopes in the afternoon. The southwest flow will continue 
overnight with mild overnight temperatures expected.  The 
approaching weather system will drop into Arizona tonight and will 
move east into New Mexico and impact the area with a mix of weather 
on Friday. 

&&

.LONG TERM...Friday through Thursday...
Friday morning starts off with a backdoor front nudging into the
eastern CWA, as well an upper level low dropping down into New
Mexico. These two systems will briefly butt heads and cause a
split in low level flow across the Borderland. The backdoor
front's forward progression will be halted along or just east of 
the Rio Grande valley by mid-day Friday. Meanwhile, the upper 
level low will continue to churn to the east while dragging a 
Pacific front in from the west. The backdoor front will create 
breezy easterly winds for locations east of the Rio Grande, while 
the Pacific front and upper level system will produce gusty 
westerly winds for the rest of the area. In more simple terms, it
will be breezy on Friday, but the direction that the breezes are 
coming from will depend upon which half of the CWA you're located 
in. Additionally, as this system pushes through the state, most of
the moisture associated with it will be within the center of the 
low and to the north. Since the center will be tracking right 
along the northern boundary of the CWA, parts of the Gila region, 
northern Sierra County, and the Sacramento Mountains may see a 
brief chance at some precipitation Friday evening and into the 
overnight hours. Snow levels will drop to about 6000 feet, so the 
higher terrain of these highlighted locations will likely see some
snow showers. Since very low dewpoints indicate there won't be 
much moisture to work with in the first place, don't expect 
accumulation to be much of anything--maybe an inch in the highest
parts of the Sacs.

This system will exit the area Saturday morning leaving us in a
northerly flow pattern. This will cause high temperatures to
struggle to reach the upper 50s, which is finally a few degrees below
normal for this time of year. (Hopefully we've finally left these
abnormally warm temperatures we've been seeing in the dust.)
Sunday will start off as a calm and pleasant day, but that will
change throughout the afternoon as a second, more potent backdoor
cold front pushes in. Easterly winds look to become quite strong,
particularly across the Otero Mesa, Hudspeth, and eastern El Paso
Counties. By midnight Monday morning, the GFS has 35-45 knots at
850mb for these locations, as well as along and south of the I-10
corridor, with a secondary bullseye of strong winds out by
Lordsburg. Expect the winds to start dying down by late morning as
the pressure gradient loosens. The exact timing of the frontal
passage will determine high temps for Sunday, but for now, expect
most everyone to warm up into the lower 60s. The cooler air will
filter in behind the front on Monday capping highs in the mid to
upper 50s. 

The first day of December looks to be rather benign for now as
northwesterly flow persists aloft. Temperatures will top out right
around normal and winds will be light. Beyond Tuesday afternoon is
when confidence starts to lower thanks to models diverging on
their solutions for our next potential weather system. Both the 
GFS and the ECMWF have a cutoff upper low dropping down somewhere 
in the Four Corners region Tuesday night. Both models also have a 
side door cold front pushing in ahead of the system during this 
time turning winds northerly. This would create a funneling effect
and thus stronger winds in north-south oriented canyons and 
valleys. Moving forward into Wednesday morning is where the models
split -- the ECMWF pivots the low around northeastern New Mexico 
and kicks it out the door into the Plains pretty quickly. The 
only impact for us in that scenario would be gusty winds and maybe
an increase in high clouds. However, the GFS now wants to take 
the cutoff low on a detour through eastern Arizona before slowly 
swinging it right over the Borderland on Thursday. If this 
solution is correct, it would create more widespread 
precipitation, much cooler temperatures, and perhaps even a decent
chance at snow for a fair amount of people. But before we get 
ahead of ourselves, it's important to realize that this is 
pushing seven to eight days away from now, so honestly, who knows 
what will happen. We'll have to keep watching and cross our 
fingers for any chance of precipitation that we can get.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Dry and warm west southwest flow will occur over the region today 
and tonight with an approaching storm system moving into the area on 
Friday.  The system will bring a mix of rain and high elevation snow 
to the mountains Friday and Friday night, but accumulations will be 
light. Lowland desert regions along the border will see dry and 
somewhat breezy conditions as a front pushes into the area. Overall 
fire impacts today will be minimal with low relative humidity values 
in the teens, with wind speeds expected to remain below criteria. 
Winds increase on Friday but so do relative humidity values as a 
result of cooler temperatures.  Vent rates will be poor to good 
today with some improvement along the Rio Grande Valley for Friday. 
Temperatures will continue to drop going into next week to about 5 
to 10 degrees below normal with little to no precipitation.
