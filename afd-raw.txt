Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service El Paso TX/Santa Teresa NM
234 PM MST Tue Nov 24 2020

.SYNOPSIS...
A windy day today as an upper system swings through the area.
Winds should calm down around sunset. Temperatures will warm to
around 5 to 10 degrees above normal mid week. Wind will be light.
Friday, another system approaches the area bringing partly cloudy
skies and some lightly breezy conditions. A coldfront moves
through Friday morning, cooling temperatures back to normal. As
the system moves through Friday, some light snow will be possible
above 7,00ft, but accumulations look to be light at this time. The
weekend will see a couple degrees of warming, then another 
coldfront moves through Monday morning. Temperatures will drop 
below normal Monday and winds could pick up. but the area will
remain dry. Temperatures will be slow to warm for next week.

.DISCUSSION...
.SHORT TERM...Tonight and Wednesday... 

Today's sharp upper-level trough will be moving away through the 
night as it exits into the Central Plains. This will allow for a 
relaxing of the gradients, and moving off of the jets aloft...to 
give us a quick drop in wind speeds through the evening hours. The 
backside of the trough and a weak Pacific front will help to turn 
our winds northwesterly. This will help to both dry and cool our 
airmass overnight. Dewpoints will drop from the 30s to the teens. 
Wednesday morning temperatures will be about 5-10 degrees cooler 
than we saw this morning. The drier air will clear out any of the 
few clouds that linger through the afternoon, for a clear night. The 
drier air, lighter winds, and clear skies will help to lower the 
overnight minimum temperatures close to seasonal averages. This 
means a lot of areas will see temperatures around the freezing mark 
and some below.

For Wednesday...the region comes under a shortwave ridge aloft to 
keep the region dry and somewhat seasonal. Skies should be clear 
across the entire region. The daytime high temperatures for 
Wednesday should be close to what we saw today with just a degree or 
two difference. These expected highs are still about 5 degrees 
warmer than the seasonal averages, despite the cool down. The big 
difference will be the lower wind speeds. There is still some 
potential for some afternoon breezes due to weak lee surface 
troughing developing east of the NM central mountain chain...but 
speeds of 15 to 20 look to be the high end of the potential...so 
much lower than today's winds. 


&&

.LONG TERM...Thursday through Wednesday...
Weak upper level ridging moves to our east at the beginning of 
the period Thursday morning. Temperatures will remain 5 to 10 
degrees above normal in areas below 7,00ft Thursday and around 
normal for areas above 7,00ft. Winds will be westerly and mostly 
light and skies clear. An approaching longwave trough cuts down NV
and into northern AZ Thursday night. This trough comes down from 
the Pacific NW, and will have precipitated much of its moisture 
out before reaching NM Friday afternoon. 

At the surface, ahead of the trough, a side door front approaches
early Friday morning. Temperatures will cool down and winds along
N/S orientated canyons and valleys will be gusty. Friday 
afternoon, the trough core sweeps through central NM. As mentioned
before, there is little moisture to work with as the jet feeding 
into this more amplified low is pulling in air from the central 
plains. With that said, this is a very cold upper level low, 
bringing with it ample dynamics and lift. With the recycled 
moisture, elevations above 7,000ft could see an inch or two of 
snow. Confidence on more snowfall is low at this time. Temperatures
will drop to normal in the low lands, and around 5 degrees below 
normal in the higher elevations. 

Saturday, the trough is already to our eastern neighbors with
colder and more dry air settling in behind it. Winds will be light
and variable, and high temperatures will drop to 5 to 10 degrees 
below normal area wide. 

A pseudo PNA pattern sets up for Monday and Tuesday, giving our 
area north westerly flow aloft for the most part. Another backdoor
coldfront pushes through early Monday morning. This is a colder 
one, and could bring in some stronger winds for over night Sunday 
and Monday morning. You guessed it... this one is dry as well. 
That surface high pressure remains over the area for the rest of 
the period, and is slow to warm up temperatures.

ED 
&
.AVIATION...18Z TAF CYCLE
Gusty SWLY/WLY winds will continue to increase through the 
morning as an upper level trough passes. Expect WLY surface 
winds to peak between 17-23z at around 22-28kt with gusts up to 
30-35kt. Occasional stronger gusts will be possible at ELP due to 
downsloping, which is why an AWW has been issued. Patchy blowing 
dust and reduced visibility will also be possible, particularly at
DMN. ISOLD and temporary VSBY 3-5 SM ovr KDMN, KELP, KLRU
possible in BLDU. Winds will subside after sunset, and shift to 
NWLY. Skies will remain SKC-FEW250, except FEW-SCT 080-110 ovr
KTCS. 

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Strong afternoon winds will quickly slacken near sunset as the upper 
trough exits the region, and cool air helps to decouple the strong 
winds aloft...and they lift up and away from the surface. Behind 
today's system a cool and dry airmass will drop in across the region 
on WNW flow. This will mean a cooler night with Wednesday morning 
temperatures very near seasonal averages...meaning some freezing 
temperatures at many locations. Dewpoints will be rapidly trending 
sharply lower overnight also, with a lower RH values expected for 
Wednesday. 

Wednesday and Thursday will be the drier days of the week, with min 
RH in the 13-18% range across the lowlands. Winds will be lighter, 
by far, but some afternoon breezes will still be possible due to lee-
side surface troughing to our east. Another upper-level storm system 
will drop in from the north on Friday. That system looks to bring in 
a cold front from the north. The system looks pretty dry, with only 
slight chances for any precipitation Friday and Saturday. However it 
will bring colder air Friday and for the weekend ahead.  Vent rates 
lower after today due to lesser wind and shallow mixing to poor to 
fair for the rest of the week.
